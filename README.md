Hello there! This is my (Jared's) public repository for a static site using the github pages jekyll and ruby workflow. You probably don't want this is you happened upon this repo by chance and are probably looking for this: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart 

## Getting Started

Begin by cloning this repository and following the prerequisite steps found here: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll

you will also need Bundle. https://bundler.io/

use the following commands to build the site then serve it.
```
bundle install
bundle update
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Visit 127.0.0.1:4000 in your browser to connect to a local version of the site.

Any changes committed to the main branch will be deployed to the live site. Ideal workflow is to work in your own branch and merge to main once you are ready.
