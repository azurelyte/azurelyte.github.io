<!-- 
ROOT should never be accessed by the user. We would normally redirect to the index/home page, but we will use the about page for now.
-->
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=/about/" />
<script type="text/javascript">
    window.location.href="/about/"
</script>
<p>
Hello there. You should be automatically redirected to the about page. If this does not occur, please click <a href="/about/">here</a>.
