<!-- 
Index is the place for the home page but, since I don't have a blog or much content, let's just redirect and use the About page as 
our landing page.
-->
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url={{ site.url }}/about/" />
<script type="text/javascript">
    window.location.href="/about/"
</script>
<p>
Hello there. You should be automatically redirected to the about page. If this does not occur, please click <a href="/about/">here</a>.
