Hello, I am Jared. A professional Game Developer with over 6 years of commercial experience developing games.

Creating exceptional game experiences that bring joy and entertainment to people is my passion. I love to focus on the intrinsic motivators of game design and bring those to the forefront of gameplay.

I have a background in Computer Science/Programming and a successful history of working on Designing Game Features, Scripting, Network/Multithreaded Programming, Texture/Build Pipelines, and VR.

I enjoy both creating games and playing a wide variety of them. Some favourites include Dwarf Fortress, Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, Factorio, Terraria, DS3, Total War: Warhammer, Old School Runescape, Skyrim, Vermintide, Dragon's Dogma, and many, many more.
