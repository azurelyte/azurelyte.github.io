I am Jared. A professional Game Developer with 7 years of commercial experience developing games.

Creating exceptional game experiences that bring joy and entertainment to people is my passion. I love to focus on the intrinsic motivators of game design and bring those to the fore front of game play.

I have a background in Computer Science/Programming and a successful history of working on Designing Game Features, Scripting, Network/Multithreaded Programming, Texture/Build Pipelines, and VR.
